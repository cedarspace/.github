## CEDaR Projects
Here is a summary of our private projects.

### City Poems

<img src="assets/city_poems_navigator.png" width="20%">
The app is a co-creation with CEDaR, a collaborative lab-studio in the Institute for Critical Indigenous Studies at UBC Vancouver, dedicated to developing relational technologies to support community-led storytelling. 

Nine  poems in Metro Vancouver are featured in our first phase of the App, which allows visitors, residents and/or poetry enthusiasts to access the poems and related content from the locations to which they refer.

We are seeking feedback about the user experience from local experts. We are currently focusing on testing its functionality on iPhones or iPads, with Androids to follow. If you would like to test the app and have an iOs device, you can access the app through TestFlight (a platform for testing beta versions of apps on Apple platforms) at this link: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/j8YkPA4B](https://testflight.apple.com/join/j8YkPA4B)

If you have an Android device and want to test City Poems, you can access the alpha test at this link: [https://play.google.com/apps/internaltest/4701679692359207385](https://play.google.com/apps/internaltest/4701679692359207385)
